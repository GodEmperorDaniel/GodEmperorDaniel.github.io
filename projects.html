            <h3>ZillaRilla - 2021 </h3>
            <p>ZillaRilla is a game project made for a ten week course at University of Skövde. The project was made by the effort of 12 talanted game development students at said school.</p>
            <p>The synopsis for ZillaRilla: Aliens invade the world and Zilla and Rilla choose to work together and fight them, just because they want to be humanity’s biggest threat again. It's an co-op action-brawler game where the goal is for both player to work together.</p>
            <p>During this development my role was that of Lead-Programmer, I had at least some part of most the programming in this game. More in depth what I worked on:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>So was responsible for most implementations like fixing animations and sound timings.</li>
                <li>I worked on the characters movement since we felt it was the most central for the games feeling.</li>
                <li>Both the characters attacks.</li> 
                <li>I was responsible for making sure the co-op controls worked like they should.</li>
                <li>I worked on the camera and how it would always fit both players in screen.</li>
                <li>I optimized the game and graphics so perfomance would be great.</li>
                <li>I was also in charge of the github repo and merging.</li>
            </ul>
