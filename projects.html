            <p>
                "Ytterligare ett spel" (in English: Yet another game) is the project that I and six other game
                developers worked on over the course of 48 hours. This project was for the Global Game Jam 2022 and the
                theme was "Duality". To fit this theme we made a coop experience where you compete against one another
                to either clean-up or graffiti the whole town.

            <h3>ZillaRilla - 2021 </h3>
            <p>ZillaRilla is a game project made for a ten week course at University of Skövde. The project was made by
                the effort of 12 talanted game development students at said school.</p>
            <p>The synopsis for ZillaRilla: Aliens invade the world and Zilla and Rilla choose to work together and
                fight them, just because they want to be humanity’s biggest threat again. It's an co-op action-brawler
                game where the goal is for both player to work together.</p>
            <p>During this development my role was that of Lead-Programmer, I had at least some part of most the
                programming in this game. More in depth what I worked on:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>So was responsible for most implementations like fixing animations and sound timings.</li>
                <li>I worked on the characters movement since we felt it was the most central for the games feeling.
                </li>
                <li>Both the characters attacks.</li>
                <li>I was responsible for making sure the co-op controls worked like they should.</li>
                <li>I worked on the camera and how it would always fit both players in screen.</li>
                <li>I optimized the game and graphics so perfomance would be great.</li>
                <li>I was also in charge of the github repo and merging.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Regression - 2020</h3>
            <p>Regression was a game project developed by 16 game development students from University of Skövde and
                required ten weeks to complete. </p>
            <p>
                Regression is a 2d psycological horror puzzle game that follows a woman suffering from great mental
                distress after the loss of a child; a loss which she blames herself for. The games goal is to help the
                woman work through her trauma and ultimatly come to acceptance of her situation... happy ending or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the development of this project I played the role of Lead-Programmer meaning I was a part of most
                things programming as well as communication between disciplines. As for more definitivly what I did in
                this project:
            </p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li> I programmed most scripts used for puzzle mechanics.</li>
                <li> I was responsible for interactions between the player and objects or npcs through custom Fungus
                    blocks (fungus being a unity package).</li>
                <li> I programmed the input handling since it was closly connected to interaction control.</li>
                <li> I was both git-master, meaning I taught the people that needed git how it should be done and
                    managed merges at the end of every day (or more regularly when needed).</li>
                <li> I involuntarily got the role of implementation-guy meaning I made sure the stuff programmed by my
                    other programmers worked as intented together.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This game project shows how I can communicate in programmer-lingo while also making it understandable
                for other disciplines, this simplifies cooperations when both parties understand each other.
